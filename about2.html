        <p class="biotext">Langston Doobs is an up and coming artist hailing from Seattle with a lush, soulful sound in the vein of Anderson Paak. or Goldlink. As a kid, Doobs grew up listening to artists such as Sade, The Temptations, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Kenny G. He later ventured off to play the trumpet, french horn, and violin and sang in his church choir; where he got his first taste of performing and stardom leading the church’s musicals.

          Doobs did not only have musical gifts, but also a talent for literary arts. It wasn't until high school that he started making his own music and due to dropping out of college in 2014, he started taking music seriously. In 2016, Doobs toured with Macklemore and Raz Simone which introduced him to many connections in the music industry. Post tour, he started working on his Debut EP titled “Guided Visions" which he released in April of 2017. Since then, he's dropped many singles including "Hiii-er”, “If You Love Yourself”, “Flower Child”, “23”, “I Don’t” and many more. Most recently, he dropped his new project “All out of Fucks” this January. Throughout 2020, Doobs plans on releasing at least 1-2 songs every month.</p>
